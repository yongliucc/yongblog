feat: implement Gin-based static file server for React frontend

- Add Go server using Gin framework to serve static files from React build
- Create build scripts for both Unix and Windows environments
- Configure server to handle SPA routing by serving index.html for unknown routes
- Add environment variable configuration for server port and Gin mode
- Optimize binary size with build flags
- Support cross-platform builds for Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Add comprehensive documentation for building and running the server
- Set up GOPROXY configuration to resolve dependency issues

This implementation allows the React frontend to be built as static files
and served efficiently by a lightweight Go server, making deployment simpler
and more performant.
